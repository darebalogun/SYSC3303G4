Objective of Iteration:
 
	Work Products for Iteration #0:
		• None your first submission is Iteration #1 (below) which includes Iteration #0.
	
	Iteration 1 – Adding the Scheduler and Elevator Subsystems.
		The goal of this iteration is to add the state machines for the scheduler and elevator subsystems assuming that
		there is only one elevator. However, you should bear in mind that for the next iteration, your system is
		expected to coordinate between the elevators in order to maximize the number of passengers carried over time
		(i.e., the throughput). Note that the floor subsystem is used to notify the scheduler that an elevator has reached
		a floor, so that once an elevator has been told to move, the floor subsystem also has to be informed so that it
		can send out messages back to the scheduler to denote the arrival by an elevator. You can either maintain a
		single event list or have separate tasks for each elevator. Perhaps you can think of another way of doing it too.
	
	Work Products for Iteration #1:
		*• “README.txt” file explaining the names of your files, set up instructions, etc.
		• Breakdown of responsibilities of each team member for this iteration
		• UML class diagram
		• State machine diagram for the scheduler and elevator subsystems.
		• Detailed set up and test instructions, including test files used
		• Code (.java files, all required Eclipse files, etc.)
